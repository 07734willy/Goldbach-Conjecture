# Goldbach-Conjecture

This repository contains optimized Python and C code for finding prime pairs that decompose each even integer, in reference to goldbach's conjecture. These optimizations were prompted from the following [reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/programminghelp/comments/95r49g/coding_help_change/), and were based off [this implementation](https://github.com/bugo99iot/mathematics/blob/master/goldbach/goldbach_sieve.py) originally.
